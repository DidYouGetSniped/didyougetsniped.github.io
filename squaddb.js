His legacy of conquest and command inspires us still. Our ranks, titles, and communications echo the traditions of ancient Rome, whose indomitable legions bent the known world to their will.
Our motto: Res, non verba — "Deeds, not words." We demand from every recruit the highest standard of conduct. Chivalry is not optional; it is our only law.`
